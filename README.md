# First overlook through High-Dimension Analysis

This repository was created in order to enable a didactic example of the three unsupervised techniques, most adopted in the literature: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Factorial Analysis (FA). For instance, was adopted a dataset from Nascimento, D. C. D., Ramos, P. L., Ennes, A., Cocolo, C., Nicola, M. J., Alonso, C., ... & Louzada, F. (2020). A reliability engineering case study of sugarcane harvesters. Gestão & Produção, 27.  The exemplification aimed to reveal latent patterns by combining all the observed sensors (Xs) unsupervised across the \#10 Mechanical Components (KM, VM, REV, RPM, TRE, TER, TCB, TEL, TML, TMO) related to the harvesters.
